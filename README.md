# Chat

### ACO

Alex Shao, Owen Zeng, Christine Chen

### Project Description:

This project is a chat room program where users can create and connect to multiple named individual chat rooms.

### Instructions:

- Clone the program from [Final Project](https://github.com/Stuycs-K/p03-final-09f-chenc-zengo-shaoa)
- Then run "make compile"
- In one terminal/machine run "make server"
- After creating the servers, on a different terminal or machine you can run the program by running "make compile" and "make client" to connect to the server
- Once connected, you should give a user name to be identified by, and then you can type to your chatroom.

Interaction (Subject to change)

- User with client will connect by running ./client `ip-address` and connect to the server.

- User will be asked for an alias to be inputted

- User will access a chat room (Or a menu with multiple rooms when that is added, will change if we get there)
