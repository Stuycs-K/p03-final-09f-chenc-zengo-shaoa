# Project Name: Chatroom

### Team Name: ACO

Roster: **Alex Shao, Owen Zeng, Christine Chen**

### Project Description:

This project is a **chat room program** where users can connect to a chat room, create an alias, and send messages concurrently with access to arrow key and scrollwheel navigation. Users may also resize the chat room at any time.

*We ended up removing the multiple chat room function of our project in order to focus on a better implementation of one chat room.*
